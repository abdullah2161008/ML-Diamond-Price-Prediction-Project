Diamond Price Prediction (Machine Learning Project)
Built a machine learning model to predict diamond prices with high accuracy.
Processed and analyzed key features like carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, and table.
Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn.
Visualized data trends to improve interpretability and identify key pricing factors.
Implemented and optimized Linear, Ridge, and Lasso Regression models using hyperparameter tuning.
