# Diamond Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict diamond prices based on key attributes such as **carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, and table**. The goal is to develop a highly accurate model to assist in diamond valuation.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains multiple attributes that influence the price of a diamond, including:
  - **Carat** (weight of the diamond)
  - **Cut** (quality of the cut: Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)
  - **Color** (grading from D (best) to J (worst))
  - **Clarity** (grading from I1 (worst) to IF (best))
  - **Depth** (total depth percentage)
  - **Table** (width of the top of the diamond relative to the widest point)
  - **Price** (target variable)

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** â€“ Data manipulation and preprocessing
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** â€“ Data visualization and EDA
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ Machine learning modeling

## Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Handled missing values and outliers.
- Applied **feature encoding** for categorical variables (cut, color, clarity).
- Scaled numerical features for better model performance.
- Performed feature selection to identify the most important predictors.

## Machine Learning Models
- **Linear Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **Hyperparameter tuning** to optimize model performance.

## Results
- Developed an optimized regression model to predict diamond prices accurately.
- Achieved high accuracy after implementing feature engineering techniques and tuning hyperparameters.
